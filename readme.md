## Usage

Start typing the name of a WordPress action or filter within `add_action()` or `add_filter()` and you'll get an autocomplete list of all matching actions or filters, plus information about the parameters and usage:

Autocomplete is also provided for the callback function. It's contextually aware and provides options for a function, a class method, a closure, an arrow function, and WordPress' built-in utility functions:

An autocompleted closure callback looks like this:

Hover information for an action or filter name looks like this:

## FAQ

### Which functions does the autocomplete list and hover information work with?

* `add_action()`
* `add_filter()`
* `remove_action()`
* `remove_filter()`
* `has_action()`
* `has_filter()`
* `doing_action()`
* `doing_filter()`
* `did_action()`
* `did_filter()`

### How can I trigger the autocomplete list if it doesn't show up?

Place your cursor within the first parameter of one of the supported functions, eg `add_action()` or `add_filter()`, and hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>. This works with any autocomplete provider, not only this extension.

### Can I disable or adjust the type declarations / type hints / docblock?

Yes, open the preferences for VS Code and go to the **Extensions -> WordPress Hooks Intellisense** section.

### Where does the list of hook names come from?

They're generated directly from the WordPress core software and updated in time for each new release. They're bundled with this extension so there's no requirement for your project to include WordPress if you don't want to, and the extension doesn't scan the files in your project looking for actions and filters.


### Can I use my own list of hook names?

Yes. Generate JSON representations of the WordPress actions and filters in your code using https://github.com/wp-hooks/generator, and the paths of the resulting JSON files(s) to extension settings; open the preferences for VS Code and go to the **Extensions -> WordPress Hooks Intellisense > Custom Hooks** section.

For each file, you can specify a `docLinkTemplate`: a [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html) template for documentation links for the file's hooks. The template receives a [Hook](https://github.com/wp-hooks/generator/blob/master/interface/index.d.ts#L30) as context and supports the following filters (in addition to [Liquid's built-in filters](https://liquidjs.com/filters/overview.html)):

* `replace_regex`
  * Description: Perform a regular expression search replace.
  * Arguments:
    1. Pattern of the regular expression, as a string (*not* a [literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#literal_notation_and_constructor)).
    2. String that replaces matches.
    3. Optionally, a string of flags added to the regular expression.
 * Example: `{{ "Interrobang???! What's that?!?" | replace_regex: "(!+\?|\?+!)[?!]*", "â€½", "g" }}`
